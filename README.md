# Installation Instructions
It is very simple to get this project running on your computer.

# Step 1: Node.js installation
Go to the official [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download node.js. I would recommend the version for all users, which should be on the left. Next, follow the installation instructions and make sure node.js is successfully installed.

# Step 2: Copying this repostiory
Go to [this repository](https://github.com/ngmhprogramming/O) and download all the files. Make sure they are all in the same folder.

# Step 3: Getting the file path
Copy the file path to the directory where all the files are. Do not go into the client folder.

# Step 4: Getting into the directory with comman prompt
Open command prompt(cmd) by searching for it in the programs list. Next, run this command `cd <Path to folder>`. Replace Path to folder with the file path you copied except the part which is repeated before the code entry. If your file path copied is `C:\Users\ME\Desktop\O` and it shows `C:\Users\ME> _` the path to folder is `Desktop\O`.

# Step 5:
Run the command `node app` This will run the project.

# Step 6: Viewing the project in localhost
Open your browser and go to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080). Enjoy. Go to command prompt and do `ctrl + c` to stop the program.
